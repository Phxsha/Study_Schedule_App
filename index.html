            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Study Schedule App was inspired by the need for a structured and easy-to-use platform to manage study schedules and objectives. As a student, I often found it challenging to keep track of all my assignments, projects, and deadlines. This app was created to solve that problem and help others like me stay organized and focused on their studies.</p>
